In July 2017 we [reported](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-40131277) that more than two thirds of police investigations into thefts and burglaries have been closed with no suspect ever being identified.

The report involved analysing over 37 million rows of data from [the official police data site](https://data.police.uk/data/) covering every crime in English police authorities since 2012. We then excluded anti-social behaviour as no outcome category is recorded. We also excluded the British Transport Police and Police Service Northern Ireland for the same reason. Police Scotland data is not kept at this site.

The data provides details of individual crimes at street level, including an approximate location, the month and year it occurred, the type of crime and the last known outcome.

Separate annual figures released by the Home Office show just under half of all crimes (48%) had their investigations completed with no suspects identified in 2015-16. This data is supplied by forces to the Home Office and is "quality assured" by statisticians, whereas the figures in the police data are constantly being updated, providing a "snap-shot" of crimes.

As a result of this report Surrey Police said it was re-submitting its records to the database: "As a result of the inaccuracies in the data, having been identified through this inquiry, Surrey Police is re-submitting its data to get this corrected."
